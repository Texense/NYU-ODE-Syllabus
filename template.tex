%	 OVERVIEW
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Overview}
Together, we are involved in one of the most significant human enterprises: describing, analyzing, and predicting the chaotic and unknown future. This course is the first course in ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and an elementary part of a much bigger picture of the dynamical system and applying mathematics to real-world problems.

If predicting the future is a one-million-word novel, then college mathematics such as calculus and linear algebra are ABC about it. Based on that, we will focus on some "grammar" (mathematical theories and proof of ODE) and "making sentences" (solving ODE problems and numerical simulations). I hope this course can also provide a glimpse of more advanced theory courses such as dynamical systems, partial differential equations, and functional analysis, as well as a tryout of solving real-world modelling problems.

%	 Learning Objectives
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Learning Objectives}
%use \begin{outline} or \begin{outline}[enumerate] to create a list with subitems. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Solving linear first and second-order ODEs, and methods of solving a few types of nonlinear ODEs that have exact solutions
\item Proving existence and uniqueness of solutions
\item Analytical skills: Laplace transforms and series solutions
\item N-dim ODE systems: qualitative analysis for linear/nonlinear systems
\item Boundary value problems
\item More analytical skills: Green's functions and Fourier series. (optional)

\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	 GRADING SCHEME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Grading Scheme}

%below is the \twentyshort environment - a list with only two inputs. However, there is a \twenty environment, which creates a list with four inputs. You can find/alter details of that table in the .cls file c. lines 320. 
\begin{twentyshort}
	%\twentyitemshort{X\%}{Attendance/Participation}
	\twentyitemshort{20\%}{Weekly Homework}
	\twentyitemshort{10\%}{Class Participation}
    \twentyitemshort{40\%}{Midterm I \& II. 20\% each}
    \twentyitemshort{30\%}{Final Exam}
\end{twentyshort}

Grades will follow the standard NYU math scale: 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ p{2.5cm} p{0.7cm} p{0.7cm} p{0.7cm} p{0.7cm} p{0.7cm} p{0.7cm} p{0.7cm} p{0.7cm} p{0.7cm}}
\hline
 Letter Grade        & A & A- & B+ & B & B- & C+ & C & D &F \\ 
 Cutoff              & 93 & 90 & 87 & 83 & 80 & 75 & 65 & 50 & <50  \\
 \hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Curving may (or may not) be added to uplift the letter grades during the final evaluation. 

\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Exams}
Two midterms will be in-class. Although exams will be computation extensive, we will tolerate numerical errors provided that the student correctly and concisely demonstrates all computational steps. On the other hand, only a small portion of scores will be granted if only the final answer is provided without any justifications.

\section{Homework Policy}
Homework should be submitted as pdf files on \href{https://www.gradescope.com/courses/360869}{Gradescope}, which always dues on \textit{\underline{Monday, 5pm}} unless otherwise specified, and our grader will return your homework grading with an explanation before Saturday. Both handwritten and latex formatted are fine, but the students are responsible for the submitted files' readability and completeness. 

We are all affected by the great uncertainty of life, and I understand that unexpected issues are always popping up. Therefore, the lowest two homework grades will be dropped (including the missed ones). In addition, the "late" deadline for each homework is \textit{\underline{Monday, 11:59pm}} in case of emergent issues. However, submissions after the deadline but before the "late" deadline will receive a grade discounted by 10\%, and submissions will not be accepted after the "late" deadline.  

\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Make-up Policy}
Make-up exams or assignments are allowed in limited scenarios provided that the student gets approval from the instructor \emph{before the due date}. An approval may be granted for typical excuses including medical reasons, religious holidays, and family emergencies.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Class Participation}
Students are expected to attend the classes, including recitations. Although attendance will not be strictly recorded, 10\% of the final evaluation is based on class participation, including in-class interactions and discussions. 

Recitations will begin from the second week in Spring 2022. Although there are multiple recitation sessions offered, the students of this section should go to recitation section \#? scheduled on \#?.

\section{Academic Integrity}
All students are expected to adhere to the codes of academic integrity specified by New York Univerisity.
